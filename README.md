# Mission to Mars

## Overview
### The web app is looking good and functioning but now we want to polish it. We will be adding images of Mars's hemispheres by scraping. We'll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and titles of those images. Monga database will store the data and then we will use a web application to display the data. We may need to alter the design of the web app to acoomodate these images. 

## Tools
### * Python using splinter, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, webdriver_manger.chrome, and flask_pymongo
### * MongoDB
### * Bootstrap 3

## Example Display
### An image was added to draw attenction to the web app. We still have our scrape data button. There is Latest Mars News and a Featured Mars Image. Under that is the four hemispheres of Mars and corresponding images.
